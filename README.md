## Name Generator using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Input a category and output one letter at a time. Recurrently predicting characters to form language (this could also be done with words or other higher order constructs) is often referred to as a “language model”

Steps involved are: 
<br>
1)Preparing the Data
<br>
2)Creating the Network
<br>
3)Training of the Network
<br>
4)Sampling the Network
