## Name Generator using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Input a category and output one letter at a time. Recurrently predicting characters to form language (this could also be done with words or other higher order constructs) is often referred to as a “language model”

Steps involved are: 
1)Preparing the Data 
2)Creating the Network 
3)Training of the Network 
4)Sampling the Network

Dependencies 
1)PyTorch 
2)glob 
3)unicodedata 
4)string 
5)random 
6)time 
7)math 
8)matplotlib

Language 
1)Python (3.6)
